 OnePlus Nord CE4 the EXTRAORDINARY!!!",5.0,"I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone. First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or sister can buy the same from Amazon.
BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.

DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.

BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.

CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.

PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly. The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.

METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.

STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.

OVERALL VERDICT: Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable.

 OnePlus Nord CE 4 – Great Overall, Just a Bit Power Hungry on Mobile Data",5.0,"I've been using the OnePlus Nord CE 4 for a few weeks now, and honestly, it’s a solid phone for the price. The performance is smooth — apps open quickly, switching between them is fast, and there’s no lag even when I’m playing games or watching videos. The display is bright, super responsive with the 120Hz refresh rate, and looks great for watching content or just scrolling.

The design feels premium even though it’s lightweight, and the camera has been surprisingly good, especially in daylight. Pictures come out sharp and colors are natural — not overly saturated.

Battery life is mostly pretty good. On Wi-Fi or casual use, it easily lasts a full day. But I did notice that it consumes a bit more battery when I’m using mobile data or doing WhatsApp video calls. It’s not terrible, but it’s noticeable, especially if you’re on video calls for a long time or out and about without Wi-Fi.

The good news is the charging is ridiculously fast. I can go from nearly 0 to 100% in around half an hour with the 100W SUPERVOOC charger, so even if the battery drains a bit faster sometimes, it’s super easy to top it up quickly.

All in all, the Nord CE 4 is a great pick if you're looking for a powerful mid-range phone with a clean user experience. Just keep in mind that video calls on mobile data can drain the battery a bit faster — but the fast charging totally makes up for it.

 Thik Thak Phone",3.0,"The display is good — smooth, with minimal bezels — and the fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive.
Performance is solid for day-to-day tasks. I don’t play heavy games, so I can’t comment on gaming performance.
The battery easily lasts a full day, but you’ll need to charge it the next day. The charger is unnecessarily fast, as the phone gets slightly warm while charging.
The camera is good but not great. It does the job, but don’t expect too much.
The software feels exactly like Realme and Oppo phones — it just carries the OxygenOS name. There’s a lot of bloatware, and you have to accept many unnecessary privacy policies and terms and conditions just to enable basic features like Global Search or the camera. If you want good software then, go for Nothing, Samsung, or Pixel phones instead.

 Thik Thak Phone",3.0,"The display is good — smooth, with minimal bezels — and the fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive.
Performance is solid for day-to-day tasks. I don’t play heavy games, so I can’t comment on gaming performance.
The battery easily lasts a full day, but you’ll need to charge it the next day. The charger is unnecessarily fast, as the phone gets slightly warm while charging.
The camera is good but not great. It does the job, but don’t expect too much.
The software feels exactly like Realme and Oppo phones — it just carries the OxygenOS name. There’s a lot of bloatware, and you have to accept many unnecessary privacy policies and terms and conditions just to enable basic features like Global Search or the camera.

 great daily driver, with one flaw",4.0,"i have a lot of phones, as amazon and flipkart already know. but, i do NOT use my mid/high end phones as my daily drivers. my gaming phones are stuck at home and have almost never seen the world outside my house. i will also tell you why i don't use my mid/high end phones outside - because i tend to drop them, crack them, etc.

but sometime in august/september i realized that i was doing so many things on my daily use phone that i needed a decent mid range phone. and that is when the search began. i had zeroed in on 4 different mid range phones, but i decided to settle on this one.

my main criteria for choosing a new phone was that it had to be decently powerful (able to create a presentation, in the worst of the cases), and MORE IMPORTANTLY, this new phone had to be very light weight.

this phone, the iqoo z10r fit the bill in every way, but one (wait for it).

the other phone i almost bought, but didn't really, was the tecno pova curve. that's a slim, light weight phone with a decent chipset (7300). it lost in the looks department.

but this phone had a lot of things going for it: a solid chipset (7400), great cameras (for a mid range phone, especially with the vivo legacy), fairly slim, and fairly light weight.

i have been using this phone as my daily driver for the past few months now, and the iqoo z10r has NOT disappointed in most departments, spare one: this phone is wide! had this phone been a little more wide... this phone would have been a square! holding the phone in a single hand is NOT easy because of how wide the phone is.

i am not a fan of the camera bump either. and the light... again, i am not a fan of it.

the front camera quality is amazing. rear cameras... i am not so sure. they are okay. my low/mid range infinix, redmi and realme phones probably take equally good, if not better pictures with their rear cameras, when compared to this phone's rear cameras.

another big problem: i think this phone could get damaged quite easily given how thin it is. just an hour back i was getting out of my friend's car, and my phone was in between my legs, or maybe i was sitting on it, and the phone fell on a concrete road, as i exited the vehicle. for a minute i thought: there goes my 20k. luckily i had bought a decently tough cover for the phone, so the phone survived (i hope). let's see... we will know if this phone can actually survive a few feet falls onto heavy concrete streets.

i have played multiple games on this phone - bgmi, racing games, some low end games, etc, and they all run smoothly. my ancient redmi k50 supports smooth + extreme+, but this phone supports only smooth + extreme. doesn't make much of a difference for me as i am a casual bgmi warrior.

overall, this is a good phone for the price, if you can overlook the fact that it is VERY WIDE!

Great Choice If You Want

A smooth 120 Hz smartphone experience

 Works faster than other mobiles at this price.",4.0,"It is very long vertically, to the extent that it feels weird. Not good if you are looking for something handy and pocket friendly. Other than that, it's 8GB RAM and 128GB storage is pretty nice for the given price point. I got it for 11k. Also a major difference maker it the processing chip, the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 AE performs miles better than all those cheap Dimensity Mediatek chips. So it would not start lagging within a year and will actually perform in intense situations, good for multi-tasking. The display is good for it's large screen and looks are also neat with that glassy back.

It's a fhd display but not support true fhd colours and smoothness.
This processor can't handle multitasking for heavy apps especially for modern days heavy games.
It's provide a 4nm tech processor but the battery draining is more than expected even in normal use so the power efficiency branding is a eyewash . You get a option for turbo charging to get rid of this .

 Works faster than other mobiles at this price.",4.0,"It is very long vertically, to the extent that it feels weird. Not good if you are looking for something handy and pocket friendly. Other than that, it's 8GB RAM and 128GB storage is pretty nice for the given price point. I got it for 11k. Also a major difference maker it the processing chip, the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 AE performs miles better than all those cheap Dimensity Mediatek chips. So it would not start lagging within a year and will actually perform in intense situations, good for multi-tasking. The display is good for it's large screen and looks are also neat with that glassy back. The only problem is the MI OS that includes unwanted apps and games and some ads as well, if you can manage those then go for this product.",Reviewed in India on 23 October 2025,20251118_114419,amazon_scraper,734,135,9,135,85,4.444444444444445,0.778,0.136,0.09,0.774,False,0.278,2,0.5780000000000001,4,1,0.022058823529411766,"['price', 'design', 'performance']",3,0.0,0.0,0.778,0.0,0.778,0.0,0.778,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,joy,0,False,neutral,"{'dominant': 'neutral', 'emotions': {}}",1,['ass'],False,False,,False,0.6601088235294117

 Good mobile and value for money (8+128)",3.0,"As per price this mobile is a good option if the budget is under 12k .
While company provide some good specs like fhd display, good processor, 108 mp camera, 33w charger they also cut cost to battery quality, speaker even in display and camera .
It's a fhd display but not support true fhd colours and smoothness.
This processor can't handle multitasking for heavy apps especially for modern days heavy games.
It's provide a 4nm tech processor but the battery draining is more than expected even in normal use so the power efficiency branding is a eyewash . You get a option for turbo charging to get rid of this .
Speaker quality is not good . Sound is not clear and loud .
But still it's a good option under 12k .
